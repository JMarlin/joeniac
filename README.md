A Logisim project aiming at implementing ENIAC-inspired technology

Being a computer history nerd, I want to know as much as I can about how historical machines operated and, of late, I decided to focus in-depth on the ENIAC for the obvious reason that it's the granddaddy of them all. After learning a bunch of the basics of ENIAC operation, I decided it could be fun to play around with designing some circuits based around similar premises. 

Note that the goal of this project is not particularly to duplicate the ENIAC, and in fact I won't be doing so. The main idea is to see how far I can get designing a machine based on decimal ring counters and perhaps semi-asynchronous stage triggering.

Would be pretty cool to lay it down in metal at some point. To that end, we're going to need to build a whole crapload of ring counters (ten per register). Thankfully, this dude has a nice compact and robust circuit to go off of: http://www.vk2zay.net/article/201
